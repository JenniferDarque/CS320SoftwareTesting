# CS320SoftwareTesting
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    *Use secure coding practices: Always follow recommended and secure coding practices for the language you are using.
    *Regularly update and patch: Make sure to keep your software, programs, and systems updated and patched. Many security vulnerabilities come from outdated software.
    *Code reviews: Peer review of code is an important process in catching bugs before they become a problem.
    *Automated Testing: Use automated tools for unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing to ensure that code is functioning as expected.
    *Penetration Testing: Conduct penetration testing to assess the security of your software application.
    
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  *Interview and Observation: Speak to end-users, observe them using related systems, and gather feedback.
  *Document Requirements: Clearly document requirements and ensure they are agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders.
  *Use Agile practices: Agile development practices like sprints, user stories, and regular retrospectives can help keep the user needs at the forefront as the program evolves.
  
How do I approach designing software?
  *Understand the Problem: Start by understanding and defining the problem the software is intended to solve.
  *Identify the Users: Identify who will use the software and understand their needs, preferences and limitations.
  *Iterative Development: Start with a basic version of the program and then enhance its features over time.
  *Design First: Plan the architecture of the software before starting to code.
  *Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation at each phase of development.
